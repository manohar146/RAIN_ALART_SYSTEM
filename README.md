# RAIN_ALART_SYSTEM
To design a rain detection system that provides a visual (LED) and audible (buzzer) alert for different rain conditions (No Rain, Light Rain, Heavy Rain), and displays the system status on an I2C 16x2 LCD display.
# üåßÔ∏è Rain Alert System (Arduino)

## Overview
This project implements a rain detection and alert system using Arduino and a rain sensor module. It monitors precipitation in real time and triggers alerts when rain is detected. The repository includes source code, documentation, pin mapping, and circuit visuals for easy replication and understanding.

## Tech Stack
- Arduino UNO (`RAIN_ALERT_SYSTEM.ino`)
- Rain sensor module
- Buzzer or LED alert output
- Excel for pin configuration
- Word documentation for system overview

## Files Included
- `RAIN_ALERT_SYSTEM.ino`: Arduino sketch for rain detection and alert logic
- `RAIN_MONITORING_ALARTING.docx`: Detailed documentation of system design and operation
- `RAIN_MONITORING_PIN_OUTS.xlsx`: Pin configuration and hardware mapping
- `Rain_monitoring_system_image.jpg`: Photo of the physical setup
- `circuit_image (15).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Real-time rain detection using embedded sensors
- Alert system triggered via buzzer or LED
- Modular code structure for easy adaptation to other platforms
- Clear documentation and pin mapping for reproducibility
- Visual assets for hardware setup and circuit layout

## How It Works
- The rain sensor detects water droplets and sends a signal to the Arduino
- Arduino processes the input and activates an alert mechanism
- Circuit and pin mapping ensure accurate signal flow and control
